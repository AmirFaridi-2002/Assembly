# MS-DOS v1.25 Source Code Exploration

The first folder in the repository contains my exploration of the **MS-DOS v1.25 source code**, specifically focusing on the `COMMAND.ASM` file. The code is written in assembly language, and I've added comments and explanations to help clarify its functionality.


# Machine Language and Assembly: Image Processing Project

The other folder contains a set of image processing tools implemented as part of the Machine Language and Assembly course. The project applies low-level programming concepts to perform operations on images using assembly and system calls.

## Features

- **Image Processing Functions**: Includes filters, matrix convolution, and noise addition, etc.
- **System Call Integration**: Utilizes system calls to open, save files, and execute Python scripts for extended processing.

This project demonstrates practical applications of assembly language in manipulating images at a low level.
